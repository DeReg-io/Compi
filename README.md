# Compey How To

Example: https://www.compey.io/choose/ce652b69-0d18-4703-9e77-e47de57b0bfa

_Note, Compey is still in a POC phase. The UX, especially on the admin side can still be a bit unintuitive. Also sorry for the long urls for now. You can create as many galleries as you wish._

1. Go to https://compey.io/add
   Enter a name for your Gallery and a password. You will need the password to access the admin page. Please save it.
2. Go to https://compey.io/admin
   You will now be redirected to your admin page, which looks like this: https://compey.io/admin/your-bucket-id.
   Please save _your-bucket-id_. If you delete your cookies, you will have to enter the bucketId and password again.
3. Upload images, using drag and drop or selecting multiple in the file menu after clicking "Choose Files".
   _Note: You can currently only upload around 5 images at once (depending on their size)_.
   After the upload finished, you will have to refresh the page to see the uploaded images.
4. Your images will be now available for comparison using following URL: https://compey.io/choose/your-bucket-id. Use the _your-bucket-id_ from the last step.
5. Analyze the results at https://compey.io/admin.
